<h1>The Best Movies According To Subrata</h1> 
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>This is my favorite fantasy romantic drama movie of all time. The best part is the middle part of the movie, where they live together. I wish I could live like this one day. :-)</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>One of the best Crime Thriller movie I have ever seen.</p>
<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>This is the best sci-fi adventure movie by the marvelous director Christopher Nolan. I almost don't like sci-fi space movies, but this one blew my mind.</p>
