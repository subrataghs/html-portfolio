<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><b>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</b><br />I'm Subrata Ghosh, an enthusiastic learner and a budding web developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life on the internet. 
  My journey with HTML and coding began not too long ago, but the excitement of turning blank screens into interactive experiences has me hooked! 
  Currently sharpening my skills in HTML, I'm on an exciting journey to craft compelling digital experiences.</p>

<p><h4>Why Web Development?</h4>
  The endless possibilities of the digital realm captivate me. I'm fascinated by how a few lines of code can transform ideas into interactive, user-friendly websites. 
  HTML is my canvas, and I'm eager to combine it with other tools and languages to bring concepts to life. 
  My fascination with web development started when I realized web development democratized creativity. 
  With just a laptop and an internet connection, I can build anything I dream of, unconstrained by traditional gatekeepers. 
  This power to create on my own terms is intoxicating. 
  Since then, I've been diving headfirst into the world of HTML, CSS, and beyond. 
  Every line of code feels like a brushstroke on a digital canvas, and I'm constantly learning new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

<p><h4>Learning and Growth:</h4>
  While I'm still a newbie, I'm proud of the skills I've picked up so far.
  Every day, I'm embracing the challenge of mastering HTML while exploring CSS and JavaScript. Each line of code written is a step forward in my quest to become a proficient web developer. 
  My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can create beautiful, functional, and accessible websites that truly captivate users.</p>

<p><h4>Beyond the code:</h4>
 When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, seeking inspiration in design trends, and occasionally lost in a good book. 
 I believe in the power of continuous learning and drawing inspiration from various sources.</p>

<p><h4>What I Aim For:</h4>
 My goal is to create clean, accessible, and visually appealing websites that not only look great but also offer a seamless user experience. 
 I'm committed to learning, improving, and ultimately contributing positively to the digital landscape.</p>
